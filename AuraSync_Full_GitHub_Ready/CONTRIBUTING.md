## 🔍 What We're Building

AuraSync is a web-based platform blending wellness, emotional intelligence, and modern digital expression. We are not building another social feed—we're building a reflection space. A calm, safe, and cleanly-coded sanctuary for personal resets.

## ✨ Contribution Guidelines

1. **Start with Purpose**  
   Before coding, ask: *How does this help the mission?* If it serves clarity, trust, creativity, or safety—you're likely on the right path.

2. **Follow the Architecture**  
   - Use modular design  
   - Maintain clean folder structure  
   - Comment minimally but clearly  
   - Keep visual styling within the established aesthetic (dark mode, soft gradients, clean spacing)

3. **Feature Contributions**  
   All new features must:
   - Be scoped to a real user need  
   - Avoid scope creep or overdesign  
   - Respect the tone and interface feel of the platform

4. **Security First**  
   Any code handling authentication, file upload, or ID validation must:
   - Be written defensively  
   - Include client-side and backend validation  
   - Avoid external dependencies that aren’t vetted or documented

5. **Pull Request Format**  
   - Include a short **title** and clear **description**  
   - Explain **why** your PR matters  
   - Link any related issue or discussion  
   - Be respectful in your reviews and open to feedback

## 🚫 What We Don’t Accept

- Clout-seeking contributions or unnecessary branding
- Insecure or untested changes to identity systems
- Experimental UI that disrupts the emotional simplicity
- Code that disregards our core user: the one seeking a quiet space to feel

## 🔐 Master Credential Note

Do not alter or reference `AVERIC.0.0` login logic unless explicitly authorized. This is a secure root identity. We protect it like a vault.

## 🧠 Creativity Is Welcome

We invite creative integrations: sound visuals, mood-based theming, interactive feedback, animation that feels *alive*. Just test it, align it, and explain it well.

We’re not just building a site. We’re creating digital sanctuary. Build accordingly.
